iuvo is a personal safety application that acts as a dead man's switch
for alerting emergency contacts in the case of a user failing to return
from a planned activity such as a camping trip, hike, or a date.

Users specify the anticipated return time from their activity, contact
information for their emergency contacts, and a message containing
the location and/or any other useful details the user would like to
include.

At the scheduled return time, if the user has not checked into iuvo
to indicate that they have returned from their activity, their
emergency contacts will be notified via email, text message, and/or
social media and directed to a page containing the activity details
provided by the user.
