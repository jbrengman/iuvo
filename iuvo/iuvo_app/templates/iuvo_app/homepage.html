After signing up for the service, go to the Add Contacts page
 and enter the names and email addresses of some trusted friends. (Don't worry; we'll never spam them or share their contact info with anyone.
 Scout's honor!)</p>

      <p><h3>2. Set Up An Alert</h3><br />
Before you leave for that solo trek of the Appalachian trail, just enter when you're leaving, when you're going to come back, and a message. If you get held up and don't turn off the notification before a specific time, your message will automatically be sent to the contacts you selected.</p>

      <p><h3>3. Go out and have fun.</h3><br />
 You can go on your hike or your date without any worries.<br />
 Once you're back from your event, turn off your reminder so your friends won't get an email telling them to check in with youâ€¦even though you've got lots of great stories to tell!</p>
